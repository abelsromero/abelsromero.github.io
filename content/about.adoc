I'd like to say that l consider myself a Software Engineer, passionate about coding, open source and many things in the Java ecosystem, especially if it’s about Groovy.
If you were to meet me, I’d be probably just cloning some github repo for fun, playing with some language, attempting to fix something or reading some article.
Always trying to learn new things.

Everything you can find here is my personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employer.
